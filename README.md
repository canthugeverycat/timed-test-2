### React/Redux Timed Test

# Objective:
Build a React application that consumes an API using Redux for state management.

# Instructions:
- You have 1.5 hours to complete the test.
- You are expected to build a simple application that fetches data from a public API and displays it.
- Use React for building UI components and Redux for state management.
- Use modern JavaScript syntax (ES6/ES7).
- Implement error handling for API requests.
- Provide comments where necessary to explain your code.
- Once you finish, push your code to a GitHub repository and share the link with the interviewer.

# Requirements:
[] Use the following public API for fetching data: [Dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/posts)
[] Display a list of posts retrieved from the API.
[] Each post should display its title and body.
[] Implement loading indicators while data is being fetched.
[] Handle errors gracefully and display an error message if data fetching fails.

# Bonus (Optional):
[] Add unit tests for your React components and Redux actions/reducers using Jest and Enzyme.

# Evaluation Criteria:
- Code organization and structure.
- Efficient use of React and Redux.
- Error handling and loading state management.
- Clean and readable code.
- Bonus points for implementing unit tests.

# Submission:
- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Send the repository link to the interviewer before the time limit expires.
Good luck!
